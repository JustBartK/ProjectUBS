## Project for UBS
## Goal:
Make a comparison between two valuation algorithms (Tsitsiklis-Van Roy vs Tilley) using the following portfolio as an example:

(a) 5-year Amerikan option on USD interest rate (Black-Scholes model for modelling the rate)

(b) USD 5-year IR swap (Black-Scholes model for modelling the rate)

Provide Expected Positive Exposure (a.k.a. Expected Exposure), and quantiles profiles of 2.5%, 97.5%. Investigate the effect of changing model parameters on the shape of the risk profiles.
